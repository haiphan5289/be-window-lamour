# ct-git-diff — Git Diff Skill for BE Window Lamour

Compare the **current branch** against a target branch or commit SHA and produce a structured, layered analysis tailored to the BE Window Lamour ASP.NET Core codebase.

---

## How to Use

Invoke as a slash command from any chat. The skill always compares **your current branch** against a base branch.

```
/ct-git-diff                    # simplest — base branch auto-detected (main, then dev, then master)
/ct-git-diff main               # compare your branch against main
/ct-git-diff abc1234            # compare against a specific commit SHA
```

Before running the diff, Claude prints a one-line confirmation so you can verify it picked the right branches:

```
Comparing: your-branch → main   (3 commits ahead)
```

**Optional filters** (add any combination):

| Flag | What it does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--full` | Show every added/removed line instead of just a summary | `/ct-git-diff main --full` |
| `--path <dir>` | Only look at files inside this folder | `/ct-git-diff main --path src/Lamour.Application` |
| `--focus <keyword>` | Only show files whose path contains this word | `/ct-git-diff main --focus UseCases` |
| `--since <date>` | Only include commits made after this date | `/ct-git-diff main --since 2024-01-01` |
| `--limit <n>` | Stop after N files (default 100) | `/ct-git-diff main --limit 30` |

Combined example:
```
/ct-git-diff main --path src/Lamour.Application --focus UseCases --limit 20
```

## Output (4 Layers)

| Layer | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1 — Diff Summary | Files changed per architecture layer (Api / Application / Domain / Infrastructure / Tests) |
| 2 — Structured Analysis | Per-file BE ASP.NET Core violations (async, EF Core, DTOs, business rules, etc.) |
| 3 — Review Checklist | Architecture, Async/EF Core, DTO discipline, Business Rules, Security — ✅ / ❌ / ➖ |
| 4 — Narrative | Plain-language PR description draft with risk areas and missing pieces |

Followed by suggested next steps (`/review-code`, `/ct-unittest`, `/ct-bugfix-skill`) — never auto-invoked.
